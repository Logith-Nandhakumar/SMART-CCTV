# SMART-CCTV
#Abstract:
SMART-CCTV uses web-cam, and automatic video analysis technologies like open-cv to automate the surveilence of a closed area. Since, we are using Computer vision in this project there is no need for anyone watch the boring surveillance videos for 24/7.Using this project, we can reduce Human work, Time, Money which is more needed in the surveillance field. Our Project aims at providing one such idea to ensure safety and security of one's own property. Smart-CCTV can perform Monitoring (which records video when face is detected), Authorize (Records video when unknown person is identified), Identify (Identifies the missing object), Record (Records video like a normal CCTV). Our security systems involve the use of web camera for capturing the frames which then used for video processing functions mentioned above. In our project we had added more quality features. We can easily detect intrusion without seeing the whole recording. Our project plays a major role in saving time and storage. In our project we had used python language alone so it will be a big advantage to carry and implement many things in our application.

Step to run the project:

1. Download the visual studio.
2. open up the project by selecting file.
3. Install opencv, skimage, face-recognition, dlib, cmake and NumPy python libraries.
4. Run the main.py file.
